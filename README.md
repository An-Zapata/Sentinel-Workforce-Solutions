### Project Overview
This project seeks to visualize and analyze sample EHS data, and communicate key findings and insights to technical and non-technical audiences. The ultimate goal was to utilize these insights to provide data-driven recommendations about how to reduce workplace incidents and cultivate a proactive health and safety culture for the Operational EHS Manager team. Additionally, we want to 
This brief analysis is visualized through one key dashboard.


### Objectives

1. **Incident Dimension Exploration**: To analyze workplace incidents across *time, location, and severity* to identify trends, high-risk seasonality, and geographic hotspots for targeted safety interventions.
2. **Employee Compliance Behavior**: To assess the impact of training completion and near-miss flagging on incident frequency and severity, providing insights into workforce safety compliance.
3. **Risk Analysis**: To detect patterns in incident severity and compliance gaps, enabling resource allocation to high-risk areas and industries for proactive risk management.

### Data Description
This dataset represents workplace incident reports from Sentinel Workforce Solutions, covering a nationwide network of job sites across multiple industries from **2022 to 2024**. Each entry corresponds to a **reported workplace incident**, capturing key details such as incident type, location, severity, compliance factors, and employee training status. The data is structured to support a **comprehensive safety analysis**, enabling an exploration of **incident trends, employee compliance behavior, and risk patterns**. It includes metrics related to incident severity (levles of severity and days lost), near-miss flagging, and training completion, allowing us to assess how compliance measures influence safety outcomes.

This dataset was inspired by Public Health EHS and workplace incident datasets on [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com/datasets), but is ultimately an AI-generated dataset to create a focused analysis for this project.

## Sentinel Workplace Solutions: Workplace Incident Analysis & Recommendations

### Executive Summary
**Incidents Over Time**
- **2022:** Incident counts remained below the annual average of 419 incidents for most of the year, until a **sharp increase in Q4**, peaking in **November at 963 incidents**.
- **2023:** The year saw an **unexpected spike in February, with 715 incidents**, well above the 398-incident annual average. Q4 **continued** to reflect **seasonal volatility**, though with slightly lower peaks compared to 2022.
- **2024:** The year began with relatively stable incident rates, with monthly incidents remaining below the 432-incident average through June. However, Q4 again followed historical trends, with October experiencing a spike and December peaking at 828 incidents, reinforcing the recurring end-of-year risk period.




**Risk Analysis**
- **Rising Incident Averages:** The **yearly average number of incidents has increased**, with 2024 recording the **highest annual average** over the three-year period. This indicates a **potential upward trend in workplace incidents**, warranting further investigation into operational and compliance factors.
- **April as a Unique Risk Period:** While **April consistently records the low incident prevalence** (well **below the three-year average** of 1,248 incidents, with a mean of **615 incidents**), it exhibits a **disproportionately high number of lost workdays per incident**. This suggests that while **fewer incidents** occur in April, they tend to be **more severe**.
